The charitys royal patron is Prince Charles, and Dame Penelope Keith has been president since 1990. All very worthy. But behind the scenes theres drama galore.</description>

<description>HAVING referred himself to the PMs ethics watchdog, chancellor Rishi Sunak is confident that a review by Lord Geidt will find he declared all his financial interests appropriately. Yet almost everything Sunak has been saying shows the inadequacy of those declarations ‚Ä&#34; notably the omission of his wifes huge financial stake in IT company Infosys.</description>

<description>RUSSIA‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine pushed through the new Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act, which aims to end the secrecy surrounding UK property ownership, particularly where Moscow gold is involved, writes Slicker. The reassuring government message is that Putin supporters, as well as kleptocrats and drug kingpins, will have ‚Äúnowhere to hide‚Äù their UK assets.</description>

<description>HOW do we wean ourselves off Russian energy? asks Old Sparky. When the energy price crisis first grabbed public attention in October, we predicted that fracking would reappear on the agenda after the dust from the COP26 conference had settled (Eye 1558).

<description>ANOTHER day, another spiral in the wests wholly confected alarm about an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine, Independent columnist Mary Dejevsky wrote on 21 January. There is no rationale for such a war whatever, and scant evidence that Putin or anyone in or near the Kremlin has anything of the sort in mind.</description>
